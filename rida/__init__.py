"""The module build orchestrator for Modularity.

The orchestrator coordinates module builds and is responsible
for a number of tasks:

- Providing an interface for module client-side tooling via
  which module build submission and build state queries are
  possible.
- Verifying the input data (modulemd, RPM SPEC files and others)
  is available and correct.
- Preparing the build environment in the supported build systems,
  such as koji.
- Scheduling and building of the module components and tracking
  the build state.
- Emitting bus messages about all state changes so that other
  infrastructure services can pick up the work.
